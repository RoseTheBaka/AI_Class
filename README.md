#### Question

Create a Python program that generates a random quote each time it is run. Your program should read in a file containing a list of quotes and their authors, randomly select one quote, and print it to the console along with its author. You should also include a README file describing how to use your program and how to add new quotes to the file.

### How to use 

To use this code:

> 01. Have both files in the same folder
> 02. Rename the path in the code file to the path of the folder the file is in
> 03. Run the code

After running the code:
> The code asks user which option they want to use 
> 01. Random Quote
> 02. Add Quote
> 03. Exit

##### Add quote formate
> The code will ask for a quote and then the author of the quote to add to the json dataset 

If the user picks a choice not suggested, it would loop back
